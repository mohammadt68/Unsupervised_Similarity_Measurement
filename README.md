# Unsupervised Similarity Measurement

We approximate the data structure in a high-dimensional feature space by joint projections of data points from different batches of input data.
Specifically, we model a batch as an affine hull of its examples. Moreover, we formulate a convex optimization problem to estimate the similarity of data points in the feature space in an unsupervised manner.
